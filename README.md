Custom scripts for genomics analysis
Scripts from the study entitled 'Ultra-conserved sequences in the genomes of highly diverse Anopheles mosquitoes, with implications for malaria vector control' published in G3:Genes Genomics Genetics, March 2021.
Scripts authored by Annie M Forster:
1. control_seq_random_bed.py made random control set from MAF file, matching UCE lengths and numbers
2. intersect_categories_Jan14.py - worked out whether a control sequence was genic, intergenic, intronic, exonic, boundary etc. 
3. control_seq_genic_intergenic_alt.py made random control set from AgamP4 reference genome, matching for UCE length, number, and genic/intergenic location
